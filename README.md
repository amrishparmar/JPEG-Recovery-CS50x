# JPEG Image Recovery
Recover JPEG images from a raw binary file dump. Part of an exercise for CS50x 2014.

## Usage
Compile using your favourite C compiler (tested with `clang`).

Dump a raw binary image (eg. from a HDD, SSD, SD card, etc.) and save as `card.raw` into the same directory as the compiled executable.

Execute the program with `./recover`. Any JPEG images that are found will be saved in the working directory.
